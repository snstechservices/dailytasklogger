## Deployment to GitHub Pages

This app can be deployed to GitHub Pages using branch-based deployment.

### Setup Instructions

1. Push your code to the `main` or `master` branch
2. Go to your repository Settings → Pages
3. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose your branch (usually `main` or `master`)
5. Select `/ (root)` as the folder
6. Click **Save**
7. Your app will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/` after a few minutes

### 🔐 Firebase Security Configuration (REQUIRED)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Firebase API keys are safe to expose in client-side code, but you MUST configure security rules.

The app uses Firebase for authentication and data sync. Before deploying:

1. **Configure Firestore Security Rules** (CRITICAL)
   - Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
   - Add rules to protect user data (see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md))
   - **Never deploy without proper security rules!**

2. **Enable Authentication**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
   - Enable Google Sign-In provider

3. **Add Authorized Domains**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings
   - Add your GitHub Pages domain: `yourusername.github.io`

4. **Optional: Restrict API Key**
   - Add domain restrictions to your API key (see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md))

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for detailed security information and [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment steps.
